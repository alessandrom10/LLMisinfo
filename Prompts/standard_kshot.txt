Claim: “People who took the jab are technically ‘non human species.’”. Made by Instagram posts. Date: 2023-09-16.
<assistant>
Reasoning: The claim that people who took the jab are technically 'non-human species' is likely based on misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine and its effects on human biology.
According to reputable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COVID-19 vaccines do not alter human DNA or change a person's species. The vaccines work by introducing a piece of genetic material called messenger RNA (mRNA) that instructs cells to produce a specific protein, which triggers an immune response to fight the virus.
There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that COVID-19 vaccines can change a person's species or make them 'non-human.' This claim is likely a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the vaccine's mechanism of action.
Final answer: false

Claim: "Drinking eight glasses of water daily boosts brain activity by 20%.". Made by John Doe. Date: 2024-05-21. Answer between: True, Mostly-True, 

Thought 1: While hydration is essential for overall bodily function, especially for maintaining cognitive performance, the exact figure of 'boosting brain activity by 20%' seems questionable. It’s plausible that staying hydrated can prevent cognitive decline associated with dehydration, but specific percentages attached to brain activity improvement might oversimplify a more complex relationship. Moreover, no substantial scientific study directly correlates drinking eight glasses of water daily to this precise level of brain activity enhancement. The number 'eight glasses' is often cited as a general guideline for hydration, not necessarily a fixed metric for improving brain function.

1. officeh2o.com: There has been a lot of recent research that suggests that water consumption directly impacts the brain. 
According to one study, drinking water can even boost your brain’s reaction time.
Before we get to the specific benefits of how water affects the brain, it may be useful to look at exactly how dehydration impacts the brain. 
2. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov: Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the impact of water supplementation on cognitive performance and mood among young adults after fasting for 12 h. In addition, the most appropriate amount of water that attenuated the impairments in cognitive performance and mood induced by dehydration was determined. 
The purpose of this research was to explore the impacts of water supplementation on cognitive performance and mood, and to determine the optimum amount of water to alleviate detriments of dehydration after 12 h water restriction.
Similarly, studies conducted among children reported that even under conditions of mild dehydration, consuming a range from 300 to 1000 mL of water resulted in better cognitive performance [ 26 , 27 , 28 ].
3. womensbrainhealth.org: In fact, studies have demonstrated that PROLONGED DEHYDRATION CAUSES GREY MATTER TO SHRINK IN BOTH SIZE AND MASS, AND CAN CAUSE THE BRAIN TO AGE PREMATURELY.In a 2013 study conducted by researchers in the U.K., mild dehydration was found to have a negative effect on the brain’s performance, whereas drinking water improved the participants’ ability to complete tasks that required a rapid response.
Drinking water can improve one’s brain health by simply increasing blood flow and oxygen to the brain – which, in turn, improves concentration and cognition (supporting memory function) and helps balance moods and emotions, reducing stress and headaches. 
Research has demonstrated that lack of water to the brain can impair short-term memory function and the recall of long-term memory, as well as cause a variety of symptoms such as brain fog, exhaustion, headaches, sleep issues, stress, anger, and depression.

Nonetheless, when results of cognitive function tests were considered independently, water intake (> 1.5 L/day compared to < 0.5 L/day from tap or bottled water and 2.2 to 4.4 L/day compared to < 1.4 L/day of water from all fluid sources) was related to better attention and short-term memory, as assessed by DST-f, over a 2-year period. 
Thus, while the biological mechanism by which water intake and a hydrated status may reduce the risk of cognitive decline is unclear, evidence suggests that aspects related to hydration and fluid homeostasis or a lack thereof, such as hormone regulation and changes in brain structure, could be a key underlying factor.
5. pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov: We critically review the most recent advances in both behavioural and neuroimaging studies of dehydration and link the findings to the known effects of water on hormonal, neurochemical and vascular functions in an attempt to suggest plausible mechanisms of action. 
Finally, we discuss how future research can best elucidate the role of water in the optimal maintenance of brain health and function. 
Herein, we integrate emerging evidence regarding the effects of both dehydration and additional acute water consumption on cognition and mood.

Thought 2: Based on the search results, the claim that drinking eight glasses of water daily boosts brain activity by 20% seems to be an oversimplification. While hydration is undeniably linked to improved cognitive performance, most studies focus on the negative effects of dehydration and how drinking water can help maintain or restore normal brain function. There’s evidence that drinking water can enhance reaction times, attention, and short-term memory, particularly in dehydrated individuals. However, the specific figure of a 20% brain activity boost lacks direct scientific support. It’s more accurate to say that proper hydration supports cognitive functions rather than boosts brain activity by a defined percentage.

Of course, dehydration can affect any part of your body but with your brain, even a small amount – as little as 1% —can affect your cognitive function. 
Not only for overall brain health, but water also helps our brains function in everyday life.
3. fayazneurosurgery.com: Research shows that there is a close link between drinking water and brain function. 
Studies show that you only need to be 1% dehydrated to experience a 5% decrease in cognitive function. 
Since the brain cannot store water and you are constantly losing water through perspiration and other body functions, it’s essential that you continuously hydrate. 
4. alfaauv.com: It is estimated that about three-quarters of our brain is water. 
If you have ever considered how much of your brain is water, then the answer to it is 80%. 
It has been noted that even a decrease of 2% of water can cause memory impairment.

When each neuropsychological test was investigated separately, participants with the highest category of intake of drinking water (1.0 to 1.5 L/day) non-statistically significantly presented with a 0.17-point increase ( β : 0.17; 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.32; p for trend = 0.021) in DST-f z -score compared to those with the lowest water intake (< 0.5 L/day) over a 2-year period (Additional file 1 : Table S2).

Thought 3: Based on these results, the claim that drinking eight glasses of water boosts brain activity by 20% seems exaggerated. The research suggests that hydration does improve cognitive functions like attention, memory, and reaction times, particularly when recovering from dehydration. However, none of the studies provide evidence of a specific, quantified boost like 20%. The improvements noted are generally modest and depend on hydration levels, not fixed amounts of water intake. Therefore, while hydration is important for maintaining cognitive performance, the claim likely overstates the effects.

3. neurogrow.com: Here are some tips for reaching your water quota each day: Use a bottle that shows the ounces on the side to help you keep track, and write it down throughout the day, so you don’t forget what number you are at after refills If you get bored of just plain water, then add lemon or herbs to change up the flavor Foods like watermelon, cucumbers, tomatoes and soups can be good sources of fluid too Avoid sugary drinks and foods that are high in sodium So, make sure that you listen to your body and recognize when you are feeling a little foggy, slower in processing, feel a headache coming on, or having trouble with your memory.
According to the Journal of the American College of Nutrition , even just 2% dehydration takes a toll on our brain function.
They found that those who drank water before performing a cognitive test had 14% increased reaction time compared to those who did not drink water.
4. dentinstitute.com: This means that dehydration, even as small as 2%, can have a negative effect on brain functions. 
However, if you drink often for long periods of time, there is evidence that alcohol can affect your brain permanently and not reverse once you become sober again.
Also, the harder you think, the more oxygen and fuel your brain will use from your blood – up to 50%.
5. healthline.com: A study in 102 men found that drinking an additional 50.7 ounces (1.5 liters) of water per day resulted in significant improvements on the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life scale, a scoring system for migraine symptoms ( 16 ). 
A 2013 study in 50 young women with overweight demonstrated that drinking an additional 16.9 ounces (500 mL) of water 3 times per day before meals for 8 weeks led to significant reductions in body weight and body fat compared with their pre-study measurements ( 27 ).
Plus, 47% of the men who drank more water reported headache improvement, while only 25% of the men in the control group reported this effect ( 16 ).

Final answer: Mostly false.

While staying hydrated does positively affect brain function, there is no evidence to support the specific claim of an exact 20% boost from drinking eight glasses of water daily. The improvements are more subtle and context-dependent, particularly in cases of dehydration, but not tied to a precise percentage.
